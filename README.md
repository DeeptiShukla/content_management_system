This is a simple content management system implemented in Ruby on Rails.

It consists of three main entities - Subject, Page & Section.

The relationship is:

SUBJECT -> PAGES -> SECTIONS.

This means a subject can have multiple pages and each page can have multiple sections.

Here's a sample example:

Subject - Hollywood actors and their movies.<br />
Pages(3) - Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Anne Hathaway.<br />
And each of the above pages have sections (in this case - the sections are the actor/actress's popular movies).<br />
