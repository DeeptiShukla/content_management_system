# README

This is a simple content management system designed in Ruby on Rails.

It consists of three main entities - Subject, Page & Section.

The relationship is:

SUBJECT -> PAGES -> SECTIONS.

This means a subject can have multiple pages and each page can have multiple sections.

Here's a sample example:

Subject - Hollywood actors and their movies.
Pages(3) - Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Anne Hathaway.
And each of the above pages have sections (in this case - the sections are the actor/actress's popular movies)
